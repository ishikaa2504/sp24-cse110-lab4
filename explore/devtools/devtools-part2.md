1. What was the bug?
'result' was a String because it was adding 2 strings together (num1 and num2)
   
2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png (or whatever image extension you would like to use) and add it to your expand/screenshots directory.
I will fix it by converting each number into an integer from a string using parseInt(num1) and parseInt(num2)
